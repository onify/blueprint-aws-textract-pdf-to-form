# Onify Blueprint: Amazon AWS Textract - PDF to form example

Example how to 1) upload files to AWS S3 and 2) process the PDF file via AWS Textract and 3) send link to form to validate data from PDF. What you need to do is decide where the data from the form should go. But that is a different story and a different Blueprint :-)

**Amazon Textract**
 
Amazon Textract is a machine learning service that automatically extracts text, handwriting and data from scanned documents that goes beyond simple optical character recognition (OCR) to identify, understand, and extract data from forms and tables. Read more: https://aws.amazon.com/textract/.
